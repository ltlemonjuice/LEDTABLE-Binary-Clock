##Project: 

A Binary Clock for my LED Table which displays time similar to my old watch.

###Important  
The lack of RTC (Real Time Clock) in the Raspberry Pi B renders this script nearly useless, unless the Raspi is connected to the internet. Without, the Raspi just resumes the time before shutdown.  

###UPDATE 30.6.2015 
There is a possibility to set the time via bluetooth. After establishing a connection to the table, the current time of the smartphone can be sent to the Pi, which can be used to set the correct time on the Pi.
